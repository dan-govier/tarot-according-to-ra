    "jungian": "The Fool represents the archetype of the Eternal Youth (puer aeternus) and the Wise Old Man simultaneously\u2014beginner's mind that is also complete wisdom. The Traveler is the Self before and after differentiation: the same consciousness that enters incarnation and exits it, unchanged by the journey yet enriched by experience. The blindfold marks the necessary not-knowing that protects free will: if we saw clearly, we could not choose authentically. The crocodile (shadow danger) and fallen column (collective failure) frame the individual's passage. The Fool is who we are beneath all roles: witness to our own drama, capable of departing any scene when it no longer serves.",
    "lacanian": "The Fool figures the subject of the unconscious\u2014the dimension of subjectivity that is not the ego, not the self-image, but the gap or discontinuity that makes self-consciousness possible. The Traveler is the barred subject ($): divided, lacking, yet capable of desire precisely because of this division. The blindfold represents structural not-knowing: the subject cannot see themselves seeing, cannot know the desire that motivates their knowing. The two bags are the objet a (behind, unknown) and the ego-ideal (in front, known): what actually causes desire versus what we believe causes it. The Fool's 'relatively fixed' nature reveals the subject as purely formal: not a substance but a position, the same empty place through which all content passes."
