The circle of flowers is no longer on ground but in sky\u2014the sacred circle is now mobile, surrounding the union wherever it flies. As Ra says, daily activity becomes 'sacramental.'",
    "character": "The Avatar lives within constant flow of spiritual energy from the Creator all the way into manifestation. Neither doubts connection with Creator nor hesitates in acting out whatever expression is called for. The Avatar's great strength is not that they have perfected themselves but that they are fully committed to submitting themselves to the rhythm of Transformations as they wash over the incarnate self, wave after wave. The bliss refuses to look away from spiritual movements of life, whether positive or negative. As Ra says, 'the crown is already upon the head.'",

Closely related to Campbell's Hero but the Traveler is the audience experiencing life through the protagonist's eyes, existing beyond the story's confines.
