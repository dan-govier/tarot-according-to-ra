Her silence is her inability to formulate her inner world in outward terms. Her perspective is that of being Other to another - passive, waiting for active approach. She desires to be known deeply.

Rich imagination always on display. Artistically inclined. Superficially chatty with air of whimsicality, but beneath is endless depth. Treats ideation as her child - nurtures it, pours attention onto it, lives vicariously through it. Generative and abundant, offering holistic thought-forms that spread like memes. Generous and motherly. Function is to offer mind complex constant stream of opportunities for self-knowledge. Motivated by joy of self-expression; characteristically spontaneous.
