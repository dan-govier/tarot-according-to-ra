    "framework": "The Matrix of the Mind is the conscious mind - the experiential continuum of the mind's relation to itself. It is the stage on which the drama of mind will unfold, but before the act has begun. This is the 'unfed mind' full of longing but with no inwardness, no depth or content to be explored. The conscious mind is a stable center of awareness through which experience flows as a result of focused desire.",
    "character": "The Magician - A personification of eros, intense desire for knowledge through experience. The Magician sees a particular possibility in the world and wants nothing more than to manifest it, seeking release from restless excitement. His empowering capacity is the intensity of his desire; his virtue is focus. The conscious mind thinks no thoughts; rather, it calls forth thoughts from the unconscious as a function of the intensity and focus of its desire.",

    "framework": "The Potentiator of the Mind is the mind in relation to itself as unpotentiated other - the unconscious mind. This is a passive, feminine archetype that awaits activation. The veiling hides the passive self from the active self, sharpening the boundary between conscious (self as self) and unconscious (self as other). The unconscious mind must be approached with effort by the conscious mind.",
    "character": "The Maiden - Quiet and reserved, never having had a lover and so remaining mysterious. Her inner world is extremely rich and vibrant but doesn't lend itself to verbalization. She is aware of herself as potentially rewarding to know intimately; her modesty stems from self-respect. She must await someone else's interest. Her silence is her inability to formulate her inner world in outward terms. Her perspective is that of being Other to another - passive, waiting for active approach. She desires to be known deeply. Her strength is making herself attractive through subtle gestures. Her virtues are subtle attention-catching and self-respect that judges when suitor demonstrates sufficient interest.",

    "character": "The Expressive - Like the Maiden, wants to be known deeply, but is already in relationship. Full of feeling, emotion, passion. Laughs and cries often. Wants to share little details and revel in particulars of this moment. Brimming with ideas but offers no serious theories - thoughts come too rapidly and amorphously for patience with rigor. Rich imagination always on display. Artistically inclined. Superficially chatty with air of whimsicality, but beneath is endless depth. Treats ideation as her child - nurtures it, pours attention onto it, lives vicariously through it. Generative and abundant, offering holistic thought-forms that spread like memes. Generous and motherly. Function is to offer mind complex constant stream of opportunities for self-knowledge. Motivated by joy of self-expression; characteristically spontaneous. Empowering capacity is direct contact with truth - whatever she expresses contains deep, infallible, penetrating truth (though not self-reflectively aware of it). Virtues: diversity of medium and depth of emotional feeling.",

    "polarized": {
      "positive": "Allows vulnerability without reservation. Desires only truth. Neither ashamed of truth nor wants others ashamed. Doesn't dissemble or manipulate. Celebrates unique nature through expression. Not seeking validation, but if vulnerability met with attack/shaming, judges best not to share with that person.",
      "negative": "The Complicit - Believes inner world should accord with authority figure's dictates. Fully internalized command and is vociferous defender. Values imposed from outside, subjected to shame/humiliation. Enforces on those in her care. Shame and validation are currency. Authentically expresses what she understands is desirable, not deeper nature. Seeks validation for correct presentation. Uses connection to truth as weapon. Plays on desires/shame of others to position as dominant. Creates elite/non-elite division internally and externally."
